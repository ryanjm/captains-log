Simple web app to practice a few things:

* Mongodb
* Mustache
* APIs
* VIM

I plan on slowly expanding it over time and trying "new" things with it.

# Captains Log

Goal is for simple log entry. Then to see all logs for user.

/  
  See all posts  
/users  
  Select a user to login as  
/users/new  
  Create a new user  
/sign-in  
  Create new session  
/sign-out  
  Destroy session  
/posts/new  
  Create new post  
/posts/:id  
  See post  
/posts/:id/edit  
  Edit post  
/posts/:id/delete  
  Delete post  
/posts/export  
  Export posts - w/ yaml front loading  
/posts/import  
  Import posts - w/ or w/o yaml front loading
